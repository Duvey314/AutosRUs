 The mpg (miles per gallon) dataset tells us the mpg of the car along with a few other key features. To find the factors that make the most difference to fuel efficiency, a multiple linear was performed on the dataset. Using all five variables wonâ€™t give use the best fit (it will likely cause overfitting) but it will tell us which features are the more important. After generating a summary of multiple linear regression model in R, we found that the ground clearance and the length of the vehicle make the most difference. These have Pr(>|t|) values of 5.21e-08 and 2.60e-12 respectively meaning that both of these values are highly significant. The intercept has a Pr(>|t|) value of 5.08e-08 which is also significant meaning there are other important variables not included. This makes sense, a lot more goes into fuel efficiency and length and ground clearance. 
The multiple R-squared value is 0.72 and the p-value is 5.35e-11. The model as is an okay predictor of mpg but not great. The r-squared value of 0.72 means that approximately 72% of our mpg predictions with this model will be correct. The p-value of 5.35e-11 also means that our results are highly significant. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
