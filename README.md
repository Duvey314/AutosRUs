### Overview
This project is a use case of R and RStudio for statistical analysis. The demo folder contains statistical analysis on sample data sets. Analysis performed include: t-test, multiple linear regression, shapiro-wilk test, creating summarization tables, and filtering and manipulation of data. The Challenge folder contains a number of analysis on two data sets, mpg and suspension. The required analysis are listed below.

* Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
* Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
* Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
* Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.

Written analysis of these tests can be found in the challenge folder as well in the MechaCarWriteUp.txt file.

### Challenges

The largest challenge for this project was the time restraint. I had to learn not only the syntax and structure of R but also relearn statistical analysis in less than a week.  My background in physics was a major benefit in this regard as the statistical analysis was a refresher rather than new concepts. The structure of R is not that hard to grasp but after python, the data manipulation seems less straight forward. The language is less self-documenting that Python and because of this I had to look much more at the help documentation (which is very good).

### Take Away

I can easily see the use case for R in statistical analysis. In the documentation, it is easy to see how much you can manipulate the data and it is fairly straight forward to create very clean plots. If deeper analysis needs to be performed there is extensive documentation on all the optional parameters to really dive into. The downside of R is that it is not much of a general-purpose language. I can see it functioning best when working in conjunction with another language.
